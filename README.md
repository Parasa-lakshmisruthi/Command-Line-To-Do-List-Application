# Command-Line-To-Do-List-Application
This is a simple yet effective console-based to-do list application built entirely with Core Java. It helps you manage your daily tasks directly from the command line, offering a clean and straightforward interface.

The application ensures data persistence, meaning your tasks are automatically saved to a local tasks.txt file when you exit and are reloaded the next time you run the application.
